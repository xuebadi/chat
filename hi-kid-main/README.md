## 🌟 What is this?

HiKid is a **completely free, forever free** open-source desktop app designed for **kids in non-English-speaking countries** to practice English speaking and listening.

Say "Hello" into the microphone, and it will chat with you in English, tell stories, and play word games — all completely offline. All data and AI run locally on your machine, nothing is uploaded to the cloud.

- 🗣️ **Just start talking** — no typing needed, speak directly and the AI understands
- 🧠 **Smart and patient** — talk about anything, it doesn't matter if you speak slowly or simply
- 🎨 **Looks like a cartoon** — cute interface that kids will love
- 🔒 **Privacy safe** — conversations, voice, and models all run locally
- 🌏 **Works without internet** — recording, recognition, synthesis, and dialogue all run through a local pipeline

> 🍎 **Currently macOS only.** Windows and Linux versions are planned — contributions welcome!

## 🏗️ Architecture

HiKid's voice conversation runs through a complete **local pipeline**:

```
User speaks → SoX(rec) recording + VAD detection ──→ ASR server speech-to-text
                                                  ↓
SoX(play) plays PCM audio ←─ TTS server speech synthesis ←─ LLM generates reply
```

| Component             | Role                                                              |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SoX**               | Audio recording, playback, format conversion, and analysis        |
| **kitten-tts-server** | Local text-to-speech (TTS), streams PCM over SSE                  |
| **asr-server**        | Local automatic speech recognition (ASR), based on Qwen3-ASR-0.6B |
| **Ollama**            | Local large language model, default `qwen3:0.6b`                  |
